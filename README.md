# Distributed systems 2017 course work
### By Superteam: Miika Moilanen 2189589 and Mohammed Al-Ani 2510129

## Synopsis

This project is a implementation of a simple distributed system for the Distributed System 2017 course in the University of Oulu. The system implements a game where players try to guess if the next card will be bigger or smaller than the previous one.

## Installation
### Node.js
The server requires Node.js to work. So if you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer you have to install it first.
This can be done either using a package manager: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
or an installer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### npm install
When Node.js is installed move to the server folder and run the next command on your terminal/command line: `npm install`.

This command will install the dependencies needed for the server to run.
